# XPert: Modelling drug-induced cellular perturbation responses with a biologically informed dual-branch Transformer

## Introduction
Systematic mapping of chemical perturbation responses is revolutionizing polypharmacological drug discovery, yet remains constrained by experimental scalability. Here, we introduce XPert, a biologically informed Dual-Branch Transformer model that predicts gene-specific drug responses across dose-time conditions, outperforming VAE-based methods. It generalizes to unseen cells, transfers knowledge to clinical settings, and reveals mechanistic insights, offering a scalable solution for precision medicine and perturbation-based drug discovery. 

## Overview
The repository is organised as follows:
- `processed_data/` contains processed data files;
- `HG_data/` contains the data for training the knowledge heterogeneous graph and the pre-trained embeddings;
- `dataset/` contains the necessary files for creating the dataset;
- `models/` contains different modules of XPert;
- `configs/` contains all the config files adapted for different datasets and scenarios;
- `experiment/` contains log files and output files;
- `scripts/` contains the scripts for training, inference, and testing the model;
- `saved_model/` contains the trained and pretrained weights;
- `evaluation_metrics/` contains all the evaluation metrics mentioned in the paper;
- `reproducing/` contains the code for reproducing the analysis results and figures from the paper;

## Requirements

### OS Requirements
The package development version is tested on Linux: Ubuntu 20.04 operating systems.

### Python Dependencies
The XPert network is built using PyTorch. You can use following commands to create conda env with related dependencies.
``` 
conda create -n xpert python=3.9
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

## Example
If you just need to quickly test the code with a demo, we provide a small example dataset that you can run using the following command. For testing with the full dataset and reproducing the results presented in the paper, please refer to the next section on [Implementation](#implementation).
``` 
bash scripts/train_example.sh
``` 

## Implementation

**Note:** Due to file size limitations, some files are not included in this repository. Please refer to [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15357711
        
        
        
        ) and [Figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28955141
        
        
        
        ) for the complete set of resources.

### Data Format
1. Paired pre- and post-treatment datasets are stored in `h5ad` format. The post-treatment gene expression data is stored in `adata.X`, while the pre-treatment data is stored in `adata.obsm["X_ctl"]`, and metadata is stored in `adata.obs`. All datasets used for XPert follow this format.

2. The processed datasets can be accessed at Figshare (URL to be updated after paper acceptance).

### Model Training
The scripts for training, inference, and testing the model are located in the `scripts/` folder. Example usage is shown below:

Run the following command to train XPert using the L1000 dataset (for predictions in multi-dose-multi-time mode, change the dataset suffix to `_mdmt`, e.g., `l1000_mdmt`). Set the `use_gradscaler` parameter to `True` to deploy flash attention for accelerating the attention computation.

``` 
python train_xpert.py --model XPert 
                      --config config_l1000
                      --drug_feat unimol
                      --nfold split_1
                      --dataset l1000_sdst
                      --use_gradscaler True
``` 


### Model Finetuning

Our paper demonstrates the powerful potential of using the L1000 dataset as a pre-training dataset. If you wish to extend this application to other datasets, we recommend using the finetuning mode.

All trained models are available for download on [Figshare](URL to be updated after paper acceptance). Please store them in the `saved_models/` folder. Modify the config file for different datasets and specify the path to the pre-trained model using the `pretrained_model` parameter.


For cold-dose-time scenarios, use the following code:

```
python train_xpert.py --model XPert 
                      --config config_l1000_cdt 
                      --drug_feat unimol
                      --nfold split_cold_dose&time_random_1_one_shot
                      --dataset l1000_mdmt
                      --use_gradscaler True
                      --pretrained_model saved_model/pretrain_mdmt_new.pth
```

For independent datasets, use the following code:
```
python train_xpert.py --model XPert 
                      --config config_cdsdb
                      --drug_feat unimol
                      --nfold split_breast_1
                      --dataset cdsdb_mdmt
                      --use_gradscaler True
                      --pretrained_model saved_model/pretrain_mdmt_full_50_epoch.pth
```

### Model Testing/Inferencing

You can use our saved model for result reproduction or novel prediction. Please set the `output_profile` parameter to `True` if you wish to output the prediction profile.


``` 
python train_xpert.py --model XPert 
                      --config config_l1000
                      --drug_feat unimol
                      --nfold split_1
                      --dataset l1000_sdst
                      --use_gradscaler True
                      --mode test
                      --output_profile True
                      --saved_model_path saved_model/l1000_sdst_warm_split.pth
``` 

If you need to extract `cls` embeddings or attention matrices for downstream analysis, we recommend running the model in `Infer` mode. Set the `output_cls_embed` and `output_attention` parameters accordingly. For step-by-step guidance on attention analysis, refer to the tutorials at `reproducing/fig3/fig3D_egfr_attn_molecule.ipynb` and `reproducing/fig6/Fig6G_differential_atttention_analysis.ipynb`. These notebooks provide reproducible examples of how to interpret attention outputs.

``` 
python train_xpert.py --model XPert 
                      --config config_l1000
                      --drug_feat unimol
                      --nfold split_1
                      --dataset l1000_sdst
                      --use_gradscaler True
                      --mode infer
                      --output_cls_embed True
                      --output_attention True
                      --saved_model_path saved_model/l1000_sdst_warm_split.pth
```
